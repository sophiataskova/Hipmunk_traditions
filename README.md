## Ransoms

Steal some "public" property from the office (e.g. stationery, snacks), and send an "anonymous" letter requesting a ransom from the rest of the company. Cool ransom ideas: scavenger hunts, solving puzzles, anything that will be fun and bonding for those completing the ransom.
When requesting a material ransom, always specify mode of delivery.
